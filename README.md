Lab 5: Interrupts
Use STM32 MCU to drive a quadrature encoder that was used to read the speed of a brushed DC motor.
Advanced timer of MCU can keep tack of the position and motor and based timer generate an inteerrupt every 0.35 sec. s that the change in position over the .25 s can be recoded accordingly.
